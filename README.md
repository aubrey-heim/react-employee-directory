## Description
This Employee Directory is created using the React library and JSX. I was able to use components to easily respond to user interaction and inputs. 20 employees are randomly generated when the page loads, and their information is shown. Users are able to search for an employee by their name, phone number, or email. Users are also able to sort the order of the employees by these fields.
